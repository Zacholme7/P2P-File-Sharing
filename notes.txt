example usage

Starting the Application
Start the first instance for Peer A: $ ./p2papp
Start the second instance for Peer B in a different terminal: $ ./p2papp
Configuring Ports
Since both instances are on the same machine, they must listen on different ports to avoid conflicts.
For example, Peer A listens on port 5000, and Peer B listens on port 5001.
Connecting to Peers
Peer A connects to Peer B using localhost (127.0.0.1) and Peer Bâ€™s port: $ connect 127.0.0.1 5001
Peer B sees an incoming connection from Peer A.
File Sharing
Peer B has shared files in their shared directory.
Peer A requests a file from Peer B: $ download somefile.txt
The file transfer occurs locally within your machine.
